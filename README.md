General description:
In the near future, people are expected to communicate with computing devices (such as smartphones) by instructions given to the device by voice. The difficulty of this task is getting to a high rate of accuracy, because there is an endless amount of possibilities of speech inputs. This field is far from being exhausted.

The systems available on the market are based mainly on "machine learning" (mainly "deep learning") and do not include "Voice highlights", punctuation and structure characterization input that were mentioned above. In our project we will want to add our original features to an existing open-source.

The potential that can be derived from our project in terms of improvement and optimization of voice commands is that the project will help the existing platforms to decode inputs more precisely and thus in optimizing voice recognition.
 
We based our project on an open-source named FreeTTS which converts text to speech. Using this platform, we could create a database of speech that is emphasized and of speech which is not emphasized. With this we are able to distinguish between speech that is emphasized and speech that is not emphasized. We did this using a classifier which uses a deep learning algorithm.

The audio detection field entered the spotlight and received many significant developments in the past recent years. We can see that Apple has developed and is constantly improving the Siri system and also Microsoft has done the same with their Cortana system.
